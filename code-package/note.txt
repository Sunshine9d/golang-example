When to Use Node.js vs. Golang?
ðŸ”¹ Use Node.js When:
âœ” You need real-time applications (WebSockets, chat apps).
âœ” Your workload is I/O-bound (handling thousands of API requests).
âœ” You prefer JavaScript for frontend-backend consistency.
âœ” You need rapid development with an extensive npm ecosystem.

ðŸ”¹ Use Golang When:
âœ” You need extreme performance (high-concurrency APIs, microservices).
âœ” You have CPU-bound workloads (data processing, AI, heavy computation).
âœ” You need lower memory usage (efficient Goroutines).
âœ” You want a compiled, statically-typed language for better reliability.
